# OMGMOG-Challenge
A test at my coding talent, set by Omgmog

As I am younger, unemployed and learning, I asked omgmog if he had any work or needed help. He said that he would give me work if I could
complete a certain challenge that he set in Under 30 minutes. To make a Button into a Pop-up notification inside of the same page. This 
Git is what I am using to write, check and Prototype the challenge. If I fail I reset my files on this Git back to square one except for
the basic Syntax he sent me.

This is just a peice of work I have to do to prove that I am good enough with writing code, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and others.
